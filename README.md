Manual Handling Quiz is useful for people who may want to refresh abit of their training. Employers may send this out to their staff to do a quick review if anyone should re-do their training soon. In Ireland employers are legaly bound to facilitating Manual Handling training within all types of work settings. But some people may need re-freshers sooner.

This quiz is based on the Irish Health and Safety Authority.
